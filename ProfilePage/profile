Task()
This is the class that represents the Task object. Note all fields are
required for the user to input when a task is created except for the
'assigned_to' field, which can be updated at any time (this is more
related to the backend design).

    Task() attributes:
        task_name: name of the task [STRING]
        assigned_project: project ID this task is part of [INTEGER]
        priority: priority level - High, Medium, or Low [STRING]
        capability_level:
        deadline:
        assigned_to:
        project_portion:

    Task() methods:
        __init__(self, task_name, assigned_project, priority, capability_level, deadline, assigned_to, project_portion): parameterized constructor
        print_task_details(task): prints all task attributes to the user clearly when called
        assign_task(self, assigned_to): assigns the task to a particular user at any time (for backend purposes)
